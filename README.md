# Project Airwaves

**Current Version: V0.1.0** - [Change log](CHANGELOG.md)

Project airwaves is a simple, currently single direction, number sorting game with the original development dating back to 2018. As mentioned, the game currently only supports a single objective of sorting an array of numbers into ascending order.

## How it works

Through two user defined settings, the value range of the numbers generated & the quantity of numbers within the array to sort, this program will randomly generate an array of integers (to the settings provided) and will immediately task the player to sort the list provided. 

## How to win
Sort the numbers... As soon as the game believes the array is in correct ascending order, the game will automatically complete.
